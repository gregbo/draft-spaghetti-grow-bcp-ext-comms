            <t>
                This document outlines a recommendation to the Internet operational community to discourage the use of BGP Extended Communities in BGP announcements.
                It includes guidance for both IP networks and Internet Exchange Points (IXPs).
                This approach helps ensure the global Internet routing system performance and helps protect Route Server stakeholders against against misconfigurations.

        <section title="Background">
            <t>
                The background for Extended Communities is to be utilized within L3-VPNs, but has also been used for operational communities within the IXP Route-servers.
                This was due to lack of support for BGP Large Communities and the need to address operational communities towards 32Bit ASNs.
                ...
            </t>
        </section>
        <section title="Recommendation">
            <t>
                Network Operators that tag route announcements with operational extended-communities for 32Bit ASNs at an IXP should replace these communities with Large Communities (RFC 8092) at the earliest convenience and follow any best common practices set out by the IXP operator or RFC 8195.
